# 3- Law and the rise of the market system

The Industrial Revolution marked a transformative period in European history, particularly in Britain (1790-1830), characterized by:

- A shift from rural to urban society, with Britain's urban population reaching 40% by 1830
- The erosion of traditional community values in favor of market-driven economics
- Massive technological advancements, including Watt's steam engine
- Social changes including urbanization, factory work, and new forms of labor division

Key concerns emerged about the impact of these changes on social and moral life, as highlighted by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers who questioned the relationship between economic growth and moral-intellectual development. The transformation was facilitated by legal and institutional changes that supported this new market system.

## Adam Smith and the Market Economy

Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" (1776) laid the foundation for understanding market economics, though it preceded the major changes of the Industrial Revolution. His key contributions included:

- Analysis of **division of labor** and **specialization** as drivers of efficiency
- Recognition of **self-interest** as the primary motivator in market transactions
- Introduction of the "**invisible hand**" concept - how private interests serve public good
- Early identification of potential **negative effects** on workers, including **mental alienation** from their work

However, Smith's view was more nuanced than later interpretations suggest. He saw economic behavior as just one aspect of human nature, not its entirety.

## Critical Perspectives on Market Society

Later scholars challenged Smith's assumptions about the natural character of market behavior:

- Karl Polanyi's groundbreaking research demonstrated that profit-driven market exchange was historically not central to human economies - instead, societies were organized around principles of **redistribution**, **reciprocity**, and **householding**. His studies of pre-market societies showed that economic activities were **deeply embedded in social relations** and **cultural practices** rather than driven by individual profit motives.
- Max Weber's influential work revealed how Protestant ethics, particularly Calvinism, helped create the capitalist mindset by promoting values like **hard work, frugality,** and the **rational pursuit of profit as religious virtues**. This cultural transformation was crucial in legitimizing and enabling the development of modern capitalism.
- Weber's detailed historical analysis showed that **pre-capitalist societies** were primarily motivated by **status maintenance** and **traditional social obligations** rather than profit maximization. Economic activities in these societies were guided by customs, social prestige, and communal responsibilities, with merchants and craftsmen typically seeking to maintain their established standard of living rather than continuously expanding their wealth.

The transformation to a market society required significant cultural and institutional changes, rather than being a natural development of human tendencies.

> The number of business hours was very moderate, perhaps five to six a day; in the rush season, where there was one, more. Earnings were moderate; enough to lead a respectable life and in good times to put away a little. On the whole relations among competitors were relatively good, with a large degree of agreement on the fundamentals of business…The form of organisation [of the industry] was traditionalistic if one considers the spirit which animated the entrepreneur: **the traditional manner of life, the traditional rate of profit, the traditional amount of work**, **the traditional manner of regulating the relationships with labour,** and **the essentially traditional circle of customers**…
Now at some time this leisureliness was suddenly destroyed, and often without any essential change in the form of organisation, such as the transition to a unified factory, to mechanical weaving, etc. What happened on the contrary was often no more than this: some young man from one of the putting-out families went into the country, carefully chose weavers for his employ, greatly increased the rigour of his supervision of their work, and thus turned them from peasants into labourers. **On the other hand he would begin to change his marketing methods by so far as possible going directly to the final consumer… and would adapt the quality of the product directly to their needs and wishes. At the same time he began to introduce the principle of low prices and large turnover.**
There was repeated what everywhere and always is the result of such a process of rationalization: those who would not follow suit had to go out of business. The idyllic state collapsed under the pressure of a bitter competitive struggle, respectable fortunes were made, and not lent out at interest but reinvested in the business. T**he old leisurely and comfortable attitude toward life gave way to a hard frugality…
The new spirit, the spirit of modern capitalism, had set to work.**
*(Weber 1914/1985, pp 66–68)*

## The Legal Framework of Capitalism

The evolution of modern capitalism was fundamentally dependent on the development of sophisticated legal frameworks and innovations that created the necessary infrastructure for complex market operations:

- **Creation of corporate legal structures and limited liability companies**
    - Enabled businesses to raise capital from multiple investors while limiting individual risk
    - Established the concept of corporate personhood, allowing organizations to enter contracts and own property
- **Development of contract law to enforce market transactions and agreements**
    - Standardized enforcement mechanisms for business agreements
    - Created predictable remedies for breach of contract
- **Property rights protection, including intellectual property laws**
    - Secured ownership rights over tangible and intangible assets
    - Protected innovations through patent law, encouraging technological advancement
    - Established trademark protections to support brand development
- **Standardization of commercial practices through merchant law**
    - Created uniform trading practices across different jurisdictions
    - Developed specialized courts for commercial disputes
    - Established common standards for international trade

These legal institutions proved crucial to the development of modern capitalism in several significant ways:

- **They reduced transaction costs in market exchanges**
    - Standardized documentation and procedures streamlined business operations
    - Clear legal frameworks minimized the need for lengthy negotiations
- **They provided predictability and security for business investments**
    - Investors could reliably assess risks and potential returns
    - Legal protections encouraged long-term capital investments
- **They enabled the accumulation and protection of capital**
    - Banking and financial institutions developed under legal protection
    - Wealth could be securely transferred across generations
- **They facilitated the expansion of markets beyond local boundaries**
    - International trade agreements became enforceable
    - Cross-border investments were protected by law

The legal system thus served a transformative dual role: it both enabled the practical functioning of capitalist markets and legitimized new forms of economic organization. This profound transformation required courts to develop sophisticated new doctrines and principles that could accommodate increasingly complex commercial needs while maintaining social order and stability. The interaction between legal innovation and economic development created a self-reinforcing cycle that drove the rapid expansion of capitalist systems worldwide.

## Polanyi's Analysis of Law and Market Society

Karl Polanyi, in his influential 1944 work "The Great Transformation," presented a groundbreaking analysis of how market capitalism emerged through deliberate legal and state intervention, rather than as a natural evolution of human economic activity. **His analysis challenged the prevailing liberal economic view that markets were a spontaneous outgrowth of human nature and trade**:

- The "self-regulating market" was not a natural development but rather a carefully orchestrated construction requiring extensive legal frameworks and state power to establish and maintain
- Legal frameworks were necessary to:
    - Create and regulate markets for what Polanyi termed "fictitious commodities" - land, labor, and money - elements that were not originally produced for sale
    - Systematically dismantle traditional social protections, communal property systems, and customary rights that had governed economic life for centuries
    - Enforce new forms of contract and property rights that would enable market transactions to function effectively
    - Establish standardized systems of weights, measures, and currency to facilitate trade
    - Create new forms of corporate organization and limited liability

Polanyi emphasized that the legal system played a crucial and multifaceted role in this transformation:

- **Primary Role - Market Creation:**
    - It facilitated the commodification of social life by creating and legitimizing new market institutions
    - It established the legal infrastructure necessary for modern capitalism, including **property rights, contract law,** and **commercial regulations**
    - It helped **transform land, labor, and money into tradeable commodities** through legal definitions and protections
- **Secondary Role - Social Protection:**
    - It later became instrumental in protecting society from the destructive aspects of market forces through labor laws, workplace safety regulations, and social welfare provisions
    - It provided mechanisms for addressing market failures and protecting public interests
    - It helped establish minimum standards for working conditions and wages

This "double movement" - the simultaneous expansion of market mechanisms and society's self-protective response - was, according to Polanyi, central to understanding modern capitalism's development and its relationship with law. He argued that this tension between market expansion and social protection continues to shape our economic and legal institutions today, as societies struggle to balance economic efficiency with social stability and human welfare.

In his analysis of the rise of capitalism Karl Polanyi sums up the “Great Transformation” brought on by the installing of the market mentality in society: 

> We submit that an avalanche of social dislocation, surpassing by far that of the enclosure period, came down upon England; that this catastrophe was the accompaniment of a vast movement of economic improvement; that an entirely new institutional mechanism was starting to act on western society; that its dangers, that cut to the quick when they first appeared were never nearly overcome.(Polanyi 1944, p 40)
> 

In summarizing the vast institutional changes described by Polanyi, we can see that law played a pivotal role in the transformation to market capitalism. This period saw capitalism develop in its most revolutionary form, without the social protections that would later emerge to mitigate market effects. The transformation was characterized by three key aspects:

- **The commodification of basic necessities and fundamental resources:**
    - All goods, including life essentials, became subject to market exchange
    - Natural resources and human labor were transformed into tradeable commodities
- **Legal frameworks that enabled market dominance:**
    - Establishment of property rights systems that allowed for ownership and transfer of basic commodities
    - Development of contract law to ensure stable market exchanges
    - Criminal law enforcement that effectively eliminated alternatives to wage labor
- **Creation of market dependence:**
    - The propertyless majority was forced to rely on wage labor for survival
    - This system generated significant profits for those who could purchase labor at low costs
    - Competition and profit maximization became the dominant economic principles

This transformation, while economically productive, led to significant social upheaval as society adapted to these new market-driven institutional arrangements.

## Colonial Expansion and Legal Frameworks

Colonial expansion played a crucial role in the development of capitalism, with legal frameworks serving as essential tools for imperial economic exploitation and resource extraction:

- **Legal justification for colonization:**
    - Development of international legal doctrines like "terra nullius" to legitimize colonial occupation
    - Creation of legal frameworks that denied sovereignty to indigenous peoples
    - Establishment of "protectorate" systems that enabled economic control while maintaining nominal local autonomy
- **Property law innovations:**
    - Implementation of European property concepts in colonial territories
    - Systematic dismantling of indigenous communal land systems
    - Creation of plantation economies through legal frameworks for land acquisition
- **Labor law developments:**
    - Legal structures supporting forced labor and indentured servitude
    - Regulations controlling indigenous workforce mobility
    - Creation of labor contracts that favored colonial enterprises

Colonial legal systems created new forms of property and labor relations that were instrumental to capital accumulation:

- Resource extraction frameworks:
    - Legal mechanisms for securing mining and natural resource rights
    - Creation of monopoly trading companies with legal privileges
    - Development of export-oriented agricultural systems

The colonial legal framework thus served a dual purpose: it legitimized the exploitation of colonial resources while creating new markets and sources of raw materials essential for industrial capitalism's growth in Europe. This legal architecture of colonialism continued to influence economic relationships long after formal colonial rule ended.

## Marx's Conception of Capital as Social Relations

One of Marx's key theoretical contributions was his insight that capital should not be understood as merely physical assets or money, but rather as a social relation between people mediated through things:

- **Capital as a social relation:**
    - Marx emphasized that capital represents specific historical relationships between people in the production process
    - These relationships are characterized by the separation of workers from the means of production
    - This separation forces workers to sell their labor power to survive
- **Legal framework supporting capital relations:**
    - Property laws that maintain the separation between workers and means of production
    - Contract laws that formalize the wage-labor relationship
    - Legal structures that protect accumulated capital and enable its reproduction

This understanding of capital as a social relation rather than a thing helps explain how legal frameworks were essential to establishing and maintaining capitalist relations of production. The law doesn't simply protect physical property, but rather enforces and reproduces specific social relationships that enable capital accumulation.

Marx argued that these social relations were historically specific rather than natural or eternal, and were maintained through both legal coercion and economic necessity. This perspective highlights how the legal system doesn't simply regulate existing economic relationships, but actively constitutes them.

## Karl Marx and the Critique of Capitalism

Marx's critique of capitalism was comprehensive and multi-faceted, offering a detailed analysis of the fundamental structures and contradictions within the capitalist system. His critique encompassed economic, social, and philosophical dimensions, revealing deep insights into how capitalism shapes human society and relations:

- **Exploitation and surplus value:**
    - Workers produce more value through their labor than they receive in wages, creating surplus value
    - This surplus is systematically appropriated by capitalists who own the means of production
    - The wage system creates an illusion of fair exchange while masking the underlying exploitation
    - The rate of exploitation increases as capitalists seek to maximize profits through longer working hours or increased productivity
    - Technological innovations often serve to intensify exploitation rather than lighten workers' burden
- **Alienation under capitalism:**
    - Workers experience profound alienation from their labor, becoming disconnected from their creative and productive capacities
    - The products of labor become alien objects that dominate and oppose the workers who created them
    - Human creative potential is reduced to a mere commodity, measured solely by its market value
    - Workers become alienated from their own human nature and from each other
    - Social relationships are increasingly mediated through market exchanges rather than direct human connections
    - The division of labor further fragments human experience and capabilities
- **Class struggle and social conflict:**
    - Capitalism inherently creates and maintains antagonistic class divisions in society
    - The interests of workers (proletariat) and capitalists (bourgeoisie) are fundamentally opposed
    - Class conflict serves as the primary driver of historical development and social change
    - The concentration of capital leads to increasing polarization between classes
    - Economic crises intensify class antagonisms and reveal systemic contradictions
    - The working class develops class consciousness through their shared experience of exploitation

Marx argued that these contradictions were not merely superficial problems but were inherent to the capitalist mode of production itself. These internal contradictions would ultimately lead to capitalism's transformation through revolutionary change. He viewed the legal system not as a neutral arbiter but as part of the superstructure that maintained these economic relations, legitimizing and enforcing capitalist property relations while masking their fundamentally exploitative nature.

- Critique of bourgeois rights and legal structures:
    - Formal legal equality serves to conceal and legitimize real economic and social inequality
    - Property rights function primarily to protect and perpetuate accumulated capital at the expense of workers
    - The state and legal system, while claiming neutrality, fundamentally serve ruling class interests
    - Legal institutions help normalize and naturalize capitalist social relations
    - The justice system primarily functions to protect private property and maintain class hierarchy
    - Democratic rights under capitalism remain largely formal rather than substantive

This comprehensive analysis led Marx to conclude that meaningful social transformation would require more than mere legal or political reform. Instead, it would necessitate a fundamental restructuring of economic relations and the social system that produces them. This would involve not just changing ownership patterns but transforming the entire mode of production and the social relations it engenders. Only through such radical transformation could humanity overcome the alienation, exploitation, and class antagonisms inherent in the capitalist system.

As we have seen at some length above, the organization of industrial production and the advent of capitalism required systematic efforts to ensure the working population would commit to factory production. Marx termed this precursor to capitalism as "original accumulation". This process involved the enclosure of lands, displacement of people from common lands, and the criminalization of nomadic lifestyles and subsistence living.

For Marx, these legal measures were crucial in forcing the newly property-less class into "wage slavery". Once established, these conditions severely limited opportunities for resistance to new economic forms. Those stripped of property had no choice but to submit to capital owners, allowing a significant portion of their labor value to be appropriated by the bourgeois class who owned the means of production - all under the guise of "free" agreement within capitalist production logic.

The notion of "freedom" in this context reveals capitalism's contradictory nature - while workers were technically "free" to enter into labor contracts, their lack of alternatives made this freedom largely illusory.

Famously, in the Manifesto (Marx and Engels, 1977): 

> We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class.
> 

In this passage from the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels explain how capitalism emerged from feudalism through a historical process. They argue that as productive forces developed within feudal society, they eventually came into conflict with existing feudal relations of production. These feudal constraints had to be broken down, and were replaced by a new system based on free market competition. This transformation wasn't just economic - it brought with it new social and political structures that supported bourgeois (capitalist) control of society.

## Base and Superstructure: Law's Role in Capitalist Society

Marx's concept of base and superstructure offers a sophisticated theoretical framework for analyzing the complex relationship between economic relations and legal institutions in capitalist society. This model helps us understand how law both emerges from and reinforces existing economic structures:

- **Economic base (Material Foundation):**
    - Encompasses the totality of production relations and productive forces in society
    - Includes the technical means of production, division of labor, and ownership patterns
    - Creates the fundamental economic relationships that shape social organization
    - Generates specific class relations and patterns of economic power
    - Determines the basic distribution of resources and wealth in society
- **Legal superstructure (Institutional Framework):**
    - Develops in response to the needs and contradictions of the economic base
    - Creates formal institutional structures that regulate social and economic relations
    - Provides ideological justification for existing economic arrangements
    - Establishes mechanisms for dispute resolution and contract enforcement
    - Shapes social consciousness through legal concepts and categories

The relationship between base and superstructure is complex and dialectical, with law serving multiple interconnected functions:

- **Legitimation function:**
    - Legal systems naturalize capitalist social relations by presenting them as inevitable and rational
    - Law creates an appearance of fairness through formal equality before the law
    - Legal ideology obscures the underlying power relations and class exploitation
    - Rights discourse provides moral legitimacy to existing economic arrangements
    - Legal institutions present themselves as neutral arbiters of social conflicts
- **Reproductive function:**
    - Legal frameworks establish and protect private property rights essential to capitalism
    - Contract law facilitates market exchanges and capital accumulation
    - Labor law regulates and stabilizes workplace relations
    - Corporate law enables complex business organizations and investment
    - Banking and financial regulations structure capital markets
- **Coercive function:**
    - Criminal law enforces property rights and maintains social order
    - State power backs legal obligations with force when necessary
    - Legal sanctions discipline workforce and regulate class conflict
    - Immigration law controls labor mobility and availability

This sophisticated theoretical framework reveals that while law appears to operate autonomously, it ultimately serves to maintain and legitimize fundamental capitalist economic relationships. The legal superstructure is not merely a passive reflection of the economic base - it actively shapes social relations through complex institutional mechanisms. However, law's transformative potential remains constrained by the underlying economic structure it emerges from and serves to reproduce.

Understanding this dialectical relationship helps explain why purely legal reforms, without corresponding changes to economic relations, often fail to achieve meaningful social transformation. It also highlights why radical social change requires addressing both the economic base and its legal-institutional superstructure in a coordinated way.

## Marxist Analysis of Legal Ideology

Marxist scholars have developed a sophisticated critique of legal ideology, examining how law functions as an ideological system that helps maintain capitalist social relations:

- **Mystification of social relations:**
    - Law presents capitalist social relations as natural and inevitable rather than historically specific
    - Legal concepts abstract from real social relationships, creating a formal system that masks underlying power dynamics
    - The language of rights and duties obscures actual material inequalities
- **False universality:**
    - Law claims to treat all subjects equally while ignoring substantive inequalities
    - Legal rights appear universal but are shaped by class positions and economic power
    - Formal equality before the law conceals real social and economic disparities
- **Individualization**:
    - Legal ideology promotes an individualistic view of society and social problems
    - Collective issues are transformed into individual disputes
    - Class relations are fragmented into series of individual legal relationships

This ideological function of law serves to legitimate existing social relations while making alternatives appear impossible or irrational. By presenting capitalist social relations in abstract legal terms, the law helps naturalize these relationships and obscure their historical and political character.

The power of legal ideology lies in its ability to shape how people understand their social world and their place within it. Through legal education, institutions, and everyday practices, legal ideology becomes part of common sense understanding, making capitalist social relations appear as the natural order of things rather than a specific historical formation that could be transformed.

Quoted from *Jurisprudence,* 

“There are multiple forms through which the ideological “obscuring” works. Law, argue Marxists, operates ideologically to “naturalise” concepts like private property and exchange through contract, as if they were essential to our constitution as human beings; to “mystify” or cover up substantive inequality through formal equality, and powerlessness through equal rights; to “depoliticise” social struggles, that is, remove their political dimension and make them appear as merely criminal; present them in a form that depletes them and renders them controllable. Here is Marx in The German Ideology (Veitch, Christodoulidis and Goldoni, 2023, 61):”

> The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has the control at the same time over the means of intellectual production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of intellectual production are subject to it.(1932, p 176)
> 

This crucial insight from Marx highlights how control over material production translates into control over the production and dissemination of ideas in society. The ruling class not only owns the means of physical production but also dominates the intellectual and cultural sphere, shaping how society thinks about itself.

Marx's analysis reveals several key mechanisms through which this ideological control operates:

- Control of educational institutions and media
- Ability to shape legal and political discourse
- Power to define what counts as "legitimate" knowledge
- Capacity to present class interests as universal interests

This connection between material and intellectual production helps explain why legal ideology is so effective at maintaining capitalist social relations. Those who control the means of production also control the production of legal concepts and categories that shape how people understand their social world.

## Polanyi's Analysis: The Great Transformation

Karl Polanyi's influential work "The Great Transformation" (1944) offers a groundbreaking analysis of how market economies emerged and transformed society. His perspective provides an essential complement to Marx's critique, highlighting the unprecedented nature of modern market systems and their profound social implications. Polanyi's analysis demonstrates that the shift to market-based economies represented not just an economic change, but a fundamental reorganization of human society itself.

Central to Polanyi's argument is the observation that market-dominated societies were entirely novel in human history. He develops this through several key themes:

- Historical perspective:
    - Prior to modern capitalism, markets were subordinate to social relations and cultural practices, serving community needs rather than directing them
    - Economic activities were deeply "embedded" in social institutions, religious practices, and cultural norms that governed their operation
    - Traditional societies maintained complex systems of reciprocity and redistribution that prevented markets from dominating social life
    - The idea of a self-regulating market system was not only unprecedented but would have been considered dangerous by earlier societies
    - Economic decisions were historically made based on social obligations and maintaining community ties rather than pure profit motives
- The "Great Transformation":
    - Creation of "fictitious commodities": land, labor, and money - treating these fundamental elements of human life as marketable goods
    - Deliberate state intervention to create and maintain market institutions, showing that "free markets" required extensive government action
    - Systematic destruction of traditional social protections, community structures, and cultural practices that had protected people from market forces
    - Widespread social dislocation as communities were disrupted and traditional ways of life were undermined
    - Emergence of organized resistance to marketization as societies attempted to protect themselves
    - Development of new forms of poverty and social inequality as market logic replaced traditional forms of social organization

Polanyi emphasizes that the transition to a market society was not a natural or spontaneous evolution, but rather required extensive state intervention and complex legal frameworks. This process, which he terms the "double movement," involved both the aggressive expansion of market relations and society's defensive attempts to protect itself from the destructive effects of unrestrained market forces. The resulting tension between market expansion and social protection became a defining feature of modern society.

Unlike classical economists who portrayed market society as the natural outcome of human propensities to "truck, barter, and exchange," Polanyi argues that the attempt to create a self-regulating market system was a utopian project that fundamentally threatened human society's fabric. He demonstrates how this attempt to subordinate social life to market logic inevitably generated protective counterforces, as communities sought to defend themselves from market-driven disruption. This analysis helps explain the historical emergence of labor laws, environmental regulations, social welfare systems, and other forms of social protection as necessary defensive responses to the destructive potential of unregulated markets.

Polanyi's insights remain highly relevant today, as societies continue to struggle with the tension between market forces and social needs. His work helps us understand both the historical uniqueness of market-dominated societies and the ongoing challenges they present to human communities and social stability.
