# Jurisprudence

Jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law. It is a scholarly study of the nature, origins, and principles of law and legal systems. Jurisprudence examines fundamental questions about law, such as:

- What is law?
- What are the sources of legal authority?
- How should laws be interpreted and applied?
- What is the relationship between law and justice?

This field of study encompasses various approaches, including analytical jurisprudence, which focuses on the logical structure of law, and normative jurisprudence, which deals with the moral and ethical foundations of law. Jurisprudence plays a crucial role in shaping legal thought, influencing the development and interpretation of laws, and informing legal education and practice.
