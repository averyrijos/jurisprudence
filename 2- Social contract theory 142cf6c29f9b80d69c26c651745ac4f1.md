## The emergence of the sovereign state – Westphalia as marker of transition

During the feudal period in Europe, political authority differed significantly from the centralized sovereignty associated with modern states. Authority was diffuse, with overlapping jurisdictions exercised by monarchs, ecclesiastical authorities, town councils, guilds, and commercial organizations, reflecting a form of legal pluralism. As Harold Berman notes, individuals could seek protection from various courts, such as serfs appealing to town courts or clerics to ecclesiastical courts. This **decentralized system** was **unsuited** to the centralization of political power needed to support the growing capitalist economy. The eventual emergence of **formal-rational legal systems**, inspired by Roman law, marked a critical shift toward unified state authority.

The concept of sovereignty began to take shape in the 16th and 17th centuries, driven by the Reformation, which undermined the Catholic Church’s authority, and the rise of secular political entities. These changes culminated in the **Treaty of Westphalia (1648)**, seen retrospectively as a pivotal moment in the development of the modern state system. 

The Treaty of Westphalia, signed in 1648, consisted of two peace treaties: the Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück. These agreements ended both the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) in the Holy Roman Empire and the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) between Spain and the Dutch Republic. The negotiations, which took place in the cities of Münster and Osnabrück in modern-day Germany, involved multiple European powers and resulted in a new framework for international relations.

The treaties introduced several revolutionary principles that would shape modern international law and diplomacy:

- **Territorial sovereignty:** States gained exclusive authority within their borders, establishing the principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs.
- **Religious tolerance:** The treaties affirmed the Peace of Augsburg (1555), allowing rulers to determine the religion of their territories while protecting religious minorities.
- **Balance of power:** The agreements established mechanisms to prevent any single state from dominating Europe, introducing the concept of diplomatic equilibrium.
- **Diplomatic relations:** The treaties institutionalized permanent diplomatic missions and multilateral negotiations as standard practice in international affairs.

The treaty solidified state jurisdiction over territories, eliminated ecclesiastical oversight, and **established the state’s monopoly on legitimate violence**, laying the foundation for **sovereignty** as a central organizing principle of both domestic and international relations. **Internally**, sovereignty created a **vertical** relationship between states and their citizens; **externally**, it positioned states as formally **equal and independent** within an international system.

The modern understanding of regulation reflects **three guiding principles** identified by Santos: **the state, the market,** and the **community**. The **state** embodies vertical obligations enforced through coercion and legitimacy, the **market** entails horizontal self-interest among economic agents, and the **community** connects individuals through non-state and non-market affiliations. These principles shaped modernity’s framework for governance and will be further explored in subsequent discussions, beginning with influential thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant, and continuing through later theoretical developments informed by historical context.

Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Feudal Europe:** This decentralized system of overlapping jurisdictions and competing authorities characterized the political landscape of medieval Europe. It created a complex network of loyalties, obligations, and power struggles that differed significantly from the modern concept of state sovereignty. This fragmented power structure set the stage for later developments in political theory and state formation, as thinkers and rulers sought to address the challenges and inefficiencies of the feudal system. Unlike modern centralized states, power was dispersed among various entities, including:
    - **Monarchs:** Kings and queens held significant authority, but their power was often limited by other forces. They relied on the support of nobles and the church to maintain their rule.
    - **Ecclesiastical authorities:** The Catholic Church wielded enormous influence, both spiritual and temporal, often rivaling secular rulers. It controlled vast lands, education, and had its own legal system (canon law).
    - **Nobles:** Feudal lords maintained considerable autonomy within their domains, owing allegiance to higher nobles or the monarch. They administered justice, collected taxes, and provided military service.
    - **Guilds:** These professional associations regulated trade and crafts, exerting economic and social influence. They controlled the quality of goods, prices, and training of apprentices.
    - **Free cities:** Some urban centers gained a degree of self-governance, operating semi-independently from feudal structures. They often had their own charters, councils, and militias.
    - **Peasants and serfs:** While not wielding direct political power, the vast majority of the population formed the base of the feudal pyramid, providing labor and resources.
- **Legal pluralism:** The coexistence of multiple legal systems was a defining feature of medieval Europe, reflecting the complex power structures of the time. This pluralistic legal landscape included:
    - **Canon law:** The ecclesiastical legal system of the Catholic Church, which governed religious matters and had jurisdiction over clergy.
    - **Feudal law:** The customary rules and obligations that governed relationships between lords and vassals within the feudal hierarchy.
    - **Royal law:** The legal authority exercised by monarchs, which gradually expanded as centralized power grew.
    - **Merchant law (Lex Mercatoria):** A system of customary law developed by merchants to facilitate trade across different jurisdictions.
    - **Local customs:** Various regions and communities had their own traditional legal practices that coexisted with broader legal systems.
- **Transition to modern sovereignty:** The 17th century marked a pivotal shift in European political structures, moving away from the fragmented feudal system towards a more unified concept of state power. This transformation was characterized by two key aspects:
    - **Internal sovereignty:** States began to establish a vertical relationship with their citizens, centralizing authority and creating a more direct link between the government and the governed. This involved standardizing laws, centralizing tax collection, and developing bureaucracies to administer state affairs more efficiently.
    - **External sovereignty:** Simultaneously, states started to recognize each other as equal entities on the international stage, forming a horizontal relationship between sovereign powers. This principle of non-interference in internal affairs of other states became a cornerstone of international relations.
- **Treaty of Westphalia (1648):** This series of peace treaties is widely regarded as a watershed moment in the development of the modern international system. Its significance lies in several key outcomes:
    - **Establishment of territorial integrity:** The treaty recognized the principle of territorial sovereignty, affirming each state's right to govern its own territory without external interference.
    - **Religious tolerance:** It ended the Thirty Years' War and established the principle of cuius regio, eius religio (whose realm, his religion), allowing rulers to determine the religion of their state.
    - **Balance of power:** The treaty introduced the concept of a balance of power in Europe, aiming to prevent any single state from becoming too powerful.
    - **Monopoly on legitimate violence:** States were recognized as having the exclusive right to use force within their borders, a crucial aspect of modern sovereignty.
- **Principles of regulation in modernity:** Building on these historical developments, sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos identifies three fundamental principles that govern modern societies:
    - **The state (vertical political obligation):** This principle encompasses the hierarchical relationship between the state and its citizens. It involves the state's authority to create and enforce laws, collect taxes, and provide public services. This vertical structure is essential for maintaining order and implementing policies on a national scale.
    - **The market (horizontal self-interested obligation):** This principle recognizes the role of economic interactions and self-interest in shaping social relations. It acknowledges that individuals and entities engage in voluntary exchanges driven by their own interests, creating a web of horizontal relationships that contribute to economic development and resource allocation.
    - **The community (horizontal non-state, non-market obligation):** This principle highlights the importance of social bonds, cultural norms, and collective identities that exist outside the realms of state authority and market transactions. It includes family ties, religious affiliations, and other forms of social organization that create obligations and expectations among community members.

The passage sets the stage for further discussion of these concepts through the works of influential thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant, emphasizing the importance of historical context in understanding the development of political theory.

## Thomas Hobbes and the Social Contract Theory

**Thomas Hobbes's** seminal work **"Leviathan" (1651)** stands as a cornerstone in the evolution of social contract theory and modern political philosophy. This groundbreaking treatise, published in the midst of the English Civil War, represents a paradigm shift in how political authority and the relationship between individuals and the state were conceptualized. Hobbes's theory, born from the tumultuous political climate of his time, offers a radical reimagining of the foundations of political society and the nature of sovereignty.

The "Leviathan" not only marks a crucial juncture in political thought but also serves as a bridge between medieval political philosophy and modern liberal democratic theory. Hobbes's innovative approach, grounded in reason and self-interest rather than divine right or traditional authority, **laid the groundwork** for subsequent social contract theorists and continues to influence political discourse to this day.

Central to Hobbes's theory is the question of "**how is social order to be established and maintained?**" This fundamental inquiry drives his exploration of human nature, political structures, and the necessity of sovereign power. Hobbes's answer to this question forms the core of his social contract theory and shapes his vision of political organization.

Key aspects of Hobbes's theory include:

- **State of Nature:** Hobbes's concept of the state of nature is a cornerstone of his political philosophy, presenting a hypothetical condition of human existence devoid of government or societal structure. **This theoretical construct serves as a powerful rhetorical device and analytical tool, allowing Hobbes to explore the fundamental nature of human interactions and the necessity of political authority**. In this primordial state, Hobbes paints a bleak and pessimistic picture of human life, famously describing it as "**solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.**" This vivid characterization encapsulates Hobbes's view of the inherent challenges and dangers faced by individuals in the absence of a governing authority. Several key aspects define Hobbes's state of nature:
    - **Equality of Vulnerability:** Hobbes argues that in this state, all individuals are essentially equal in their ability to harm one another. Even the strongest person can be overcome by the weakest through cunning or alliance with others. This fundamental equality of threat creates a constant state of insecurity.
    - **Scarcity of Resources:** Limited resources in the state of nature lead to competition and conflict. Without established property rights or mechanisms for fair distribution, individuals must constantly struggle to secure their basic needs.
    - **Absence of Law and Justice:** With no overarching authority to establish and enforce rules, there can be no concept of justice or injustice. What one can obtain and keep by force becomes the only measure of right.
    - **Perpetual Conflict:** The combination of equality, scarcity, and lawlessness results in a "war of all against all." Individuals, driven by self-interest and fear, are in constant conflict, unable to trust or cooperate effectively with one another.
    - In the state of nature, anything goes. Hobbes describes this condition as follows:
        
        > To this war of every man against every man, this also is consequent; that nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice, have there no place. **Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice.** Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues. **Justice and injustice are none of the faculties neither of the body nor mind…They are qualities that relate to men in society, not in solitude.** It is consequent also to the same condition that there be no propriety, no dominion, no mine and thine distinct; *but only that to be every man’s that he can get, and for so long as he can keep it*. (Hobbes 1996, p 90)
        > 

It's important to note that Hobbes did not present the state of nature as a historical reality, but rather as a logical construct to understand the foundations of political society. His stark depiction has been both influential and controversial, sparking debates about human nature, the origins of political authority, and the proper balance between individual liberty and collective security that continue to this day.

- **Social Contract:** Hobbes's concept of the social contract is a cornerstone of his political philosophy. In this theory, i**ndividuals, driven by rational self-interest, collectively agree to surrender certain natural rights to a sovereign authority.** This mutual agreement is seen as a necessary and logical choice made by individuals seeking to escape the perils of the state of nature. **The social contract, in Hobbes's view, is not a historical event but a conceptual framework to understand the legitimacy of political authority**. In exchange for protection and stability, people relinquish their right to use force against others and **submit to the rule of the sovereign**. This transfer of rights is comprehensive, as Hobbes argues that partial submission would be insufficient to guarantee peace and security. The social contract, therefore, involves a total alienation of individual rights to the sovereign, with the expectation that the sovereign will use this power to maintain order and protect the lives and property of the subjects. Hobbes's social contract theory *differs* from later interpretations in its emphasis on the irrevocability of the agreement. **Once entered into, Hobbes argues, the social contract cannot be legitimately broken by the subjects, as doing so would risk a return to the chaotic state of nature.** This aspect of Hobbes's theory has been both influential and controversial in subsequent political thought.
- **Absolute Sovereignty:** Central to Hobbes's political theory is the concept of absolute sovereignty. **He advocates for a powerful, centralized authority with virtually unlimited power, which he terms the "Leviathan."** This sovereign entity, whether embodied in a monarch or an assembly, **is deemed necessary to maintain peace and prevent society from descending back into the chaotic state of nature**. The sovereign's absolute power, in Hobbes's view, extends to all aspects of social and political life. **This includes the right to make and enforce laws, wage war, regulate property, and even determine religious practices within the commonwealth.** Hobbes argues that this concentration of power is essential for maintaining social order and protecting individuals from the constant threat of violence that characterizes the state of nature. Importantly, Hobbes's concept of absolute sovereignty is not based on divine right or traditional authority, but on the consent of the governed through the social contract. This marks a significant shift in political thought, as it grounds political legitimacy in human agency rather than external or supernatural sources. **Critics** of Hobbes have often pointed to this aspect of his theory as potentially justifying authoritarian rule. However, **defenders** argue that Hobbes's absolute sovereign is constrained by the purpose for which it was created – namely, to ensure the safety and well-being of its subjects. If the sovereign fails in this primary duty, Hobbes suggests that the social contract may be considered void.
- **Individualism:** Hobbes's theory marks a significant shift in political philosophy by **placing the individual at the center** of political legitimacy. Unlike earlier theories that derived political authority from divine right, tradition, or natural law, Hobbes grounds his argument in the rational self-interest of individuals. This focus on individual agency and consent as the basis for political authority paved the way for later developments in liberal political thought. In Hobbes's framework, the state and its institutions are artificial constructs created by individuals to serve their interests, rather than natural or divinely ordained entities. **This perspective emphasizes the role of human reason and choice in the formation of political systems, a radical departure from prevailing views of his time.** Hobbes's individualism is also evident in his conception of natural rights. In the state of nature, he argues, individuals possess unlimited natural rights, including the right to self-preservation. **The social contract involves the voluntary limitation of these rights in exchange for security, but the fundamental basis of political legitimacy remains the individual's consent.** This individualistic approach had profound implications for subsequent political theory, influencing thinkers like Locke and Rousseau, and contributing to the development of concepts such as i**ndividual rights, popular sovereignty**, and the **social contract tradition** in Western political thought.
- **Equality:** A fundamental tenet of Hobbes's philosophy is the **natural equality of all individuals**. In the state of nature, he argues, all people are essentially equal in their ability to threaten each other's lives. This **equality of vulnerability** forms the basis for the social contract, as it provides a common incentive for all individuals to seek protection through a sovereign power. Hobbes's concept of equality is primarily focused on physical and intellectual capabilities. **He asserts that while individuals may differ in strength or intelligence, these differences are not significant enough to provide lasting security or dominance in the state of nature**. **Even the strongest individual, Hobbes argues, can be overcome by the weakest through cunning or alliance with others.** This notion of natural equality was revolutionary for its time, challenging prevailing hierarchical views of society. It implied that **political authority could not be justified based on natural superiority or inferiority, but must instead be grounded in the consent of equal individuals.** This concept of equality influenced subsequent political theories and played a crucial role in the development of modern democratic thought. However, it's important to note that Hobbes's conception of equality does not extend to political or social equality within the commonwealth. Once the social contract is established, Hobbes argues for a hierarchical political structure with absolute authority vested in the sovereign. **The initial equality in the state of nature gives way to political inequality in civil society, which Hobbes sees as necessary for maintaining order and peace.**
- **Consent:** The legitimacy of the sovereign, in Hobbes's view, stems from **the consent of the governed**. This concept of consent is crucial to Hobbes's theory, as it provides the **basis for the sovereign's authority** and **distinguishes his approach from earlier justifications** of political power based on **divine right** or **tradition.** However, Hobbes's understanding of consent is quite different from modern interpretations**. In his theory, consent is understood as a one-time, irrevocable act**. Once individuals have agreed to the social contract, they cannot withdraw their consent or rebel against the sovereign without risking a return to the state of nature. **This concept of perpetual consent is based on Hobbes's belief in the necessity of absolute sovereignty for maintaining peace and order.** Hobbes argues that consent can be either express or tacit. **Express consent** involves an explicit agreement to the social contract, while **tacit consent** is implied by an individual's continued residence within the commonwealth and acceptance of its protection. This idea of tacit consent has been influential but also controversial in subsequent political theory. While Hobbes's concept of consent may seem limited by modern standards, it was groundbreaking for its time. It introduced the idea that political authority should be based on the **will of the people** rather than divine right or tradition. **This concept laid the groundwork for later developments in democratic theory and the idea of popular sovereignty**. However, **critics** have pointed out that **Hobbes's theory of consent,** combined with his advocacy for **absolute sovereignty**, **leaves little room for ongoing political participation or dissent**. This tension between consent and absolute authority has been a subject of debate in political philosophy ever since, with later thinkers like Locke and Rousseau developing alternative theories of consent and political legitimacy.

Hobbes's theory, while often criticized for its seemingly authoritarian implications, was groundbreaking in its systematic approach to political philosophy. By grounding political legitimacy in individual self-interest and rational choice, Hobbes laid the foundation for subsequent social contract theories and influenced the development of modern concepts of rights, liberty, and the role of government.

## Hobbes’s social contract theory

Hobbes's social contract theory, as articulated in his seminal work "Leviathan" and described in this passage, represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding the foundations of political authority and social order. This complex and influential theory can be summarized and elaborated upon as follows:

- **Premise of the State of Nature:** Hobbes begins by positing a hypothetical "state of nature" - a condition of human existence prior to the establishment of organized society. In this state, Hobbes argues, life is characterized by constant conflict, insecurity, and fear. Without a common power to keep people in check, individuals are in a perpetual "war of all against all," making life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
- **Rational Self-Interest:** Given the harsh realities of the state of nature, Hobbes contends that individuals, driven by rational self-interest and a desire for self-preservation, would naturally seek a way out of this perilous condition. This rational calculation forms the basis for the social contract.
- **The Social Contract:** The core of Hobbes's theory is the idea of a social contract - a mutual agreement among individuals to surrender certain natural rights to a sovereign authority in exchange for peace, security, and the protection of remaining rights. This contract is not a historical event but a conceptual framework for understanding political legitimacy.
- **Creation of the Sovereign:** Through the social contract, individuals collectively create and empower a sovereign authority - the "Leviathan" - to govern and maintain order. This sovereign could be an individual monarch or an assembly, but regardless of its form, it possesses absolute authority.
- **Absolute Sovereignty:** Hobbes argues for the necessity of an all-powerful sovereign. This authority has the exclusive right to make and enforce laws, wage war, regulate property, and even determine religious practices within the commonwealth. The absolute nature of this sovereignty is deemed essential for maintaining peace and preventing a relapse into the chaotic state of nature.
- **Obligations of the Subjects:** In Hobbes's framework, once individuals enter into the social contract, they owe complete obedience to the sovereign. This obedience is seen as the price of security and the key to maintaining social order.
- **Limited Right of Resistance:** While Hobbes generally argues against the right of rebellion, he does allow for one crucial exception: individuals retain the right to resist if their life is directly threatened, as self-preservation is the fundamental reason for entering the social contract in the first place.
- **Practical Implementation:** Hobbes recognizes that the theoretical social contract must be practically implemented through the institutionalized organization of power. This involves the creation of a government apparatus capable of enforcing laws and maintaining order.
- **Enforcement of Covenants:** A key aspect of Hobbes's theory is the idea that agreements or "covenants" have no force without the threat of the "public sword" - the sovereign's power to enforce them. This underscores the practical necessity of a strong central authority in Hobbes's political vision.

Hobbes's social contract theory marked a significant departure from previous political philosophies by grounding political legitimacy in human agency and rational choice rather than divine right or tradition. While often criticized for its seemingly authoritarian implications, Hobbes's theory has been immensely influential, laying the groundwork for subsequent social contract theories and contributing to the development of modern concepts of rights, liberty, and the role of government.

## Summary of Hobbes

**Thomas Hobbes's theory of sovereignty**, as outlined in *Leviathan*, provides a groundbreaking and profoundly influential account of the foundations of modern political and legal theory. Central to his vision is the creation of a strong, centralized authority—the sovereign—whose power is derived from the collective will of the people. This authority, which the people consent to create, is necessary to escape the chaos and violence of the natural state, which Hobbes famously described as a "war of all against all." In surrendering their individual freedoms, people establish a civil society where peace, order, and security are prioritized. Hobbes underscores that the sovereign’s power must be absolute, allowing no dissent, as only such concentrated authority can ensure stability and prevent the return to anarchy.

The frontispiece of *Leviathan* powerfully symbolizes this idea, depicting the sovereign as a giant figure composed of the bodies of its subjects, holding a sword and a crozier. The image encapsulates the dual authority of the sovereign: civil and religious power. Hobbes’s insistence on the consolidation of these powers reflects his historical context, particularly the devastating effects of religiously motivated civil wars. By uniting civil and religious authority, the sovereign stands above the church and becomes the ultimate arbiter of law and order. However, Hobbes carefully delineates the limits of this authority. While the sovereign may regulate external actions, it cannot intrude on the internal conscience of individuals, thereby planting the seeds of a nascent liberalism.

The sovereign’s authority is described as both omnipotent and mortal. On one hand, it wields god-like power over its subjects, commanding absolute obedience and holding the exclusive right to make laws. On the other hand, the sovereign is a human creation, an "artificial man," susceptible to destruction. This mortality of the sovereign becomes evident in instances of civil war, where the state may collapse, and its authority disintegrates. Hobbes underscores that the state is not a natural or divine entity but a human-made artifice, established through deliberate agreements—“pacts and covenants”—analogous to God’s creation of man. This view directly challenges pre-modern conceptions, such as Aristotle’s belief that humans are naturally inclined to live in a state and that rulers derive their authority from divine right or natural hierarchy.

Hobbes’s theory thus marks a decisive break from the ancient and medieval world, replacing religious and natural justifications for authority with a secular and human-centered framework. The sovereign’s commands constitute the law, and without law, Hobbes argues, there can be no standards of justice or injustice, no rights or property. This positions the sovereign as the sole source of legal and moral order, underscoring the radical implications of his argument: moral and legal standards are human constructs, entirely contingent on the authority of the state.

At the heart of Hobbes’s account are the themes of individualism, equality, and consent, which are central to modern political thought. Hobbes begins with the premise of a state of nature where individuals, naturally equal in their faculties, exist in a condition of constant competition and mistrust. This natural equality, while a source of conflict, also underpins the social contract, as no individual can claim inherent superiority over others. In forming the social contract, individuals collectively agree to submit to a sovereign authority to secure their self-preservation and achieve peace. This act of submission simultaneously obligates and liberates the individual, as the protection afforded by the sovereign enables them to pursue their own interests, provided they obey the law.

Equality is a foundational principle in Hobbes’s theory, not only in the sense of natural equality but also in its implications for justice and governance. Hobbes argues that the rights and obligations granted to one individual must logically apply to all, reflecting a universalism rooted in the Golden Rule: “Whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do ye to them.” This egalitarian principle challenges pre-modern hierarchies and establishes equality as central to the legitimacy of the sovereign state.

Hobbes’s introduction of consent as the basis for sovereign authority is equally revolutionary. Unlike earlier theories that grounded political authority in divine will or inherited rights, Hobbes emphasizes that the state is a human creation, formed through the consent of individuals seeking security and order. While this consent is minimal and final—once given, it cannot be withdrawn—it lays the groundwork for future developments in political theory. Hobbes’s acknowledgment that sovereignty could reside in “one man or one assembly of men” hints at the possibility of representative government, a concept that later thinkers would expand upon in more democratic directions.

Despite his authoritarian tendencies, Hobbes’s emphasis on individualism, equality, and consent sows the seeds of modern liberalism. His theory underscores the human capacity to create and sustain political and legal systems, positioning human creativity and agency at the center of political life. By separating law from morality and defining law as the command of the sovereign, Hobbes prefigures the principles of legal positivism. His insistence that laws derive their authority from the sovereign, not from moral or religious considerations, marks a significant departure from pre-modern legal thought and establishes the foundation for modern secular legal systems.

Hobbes’s vision of the sovereign state, with its emphasis on absolute authority and the necessity of obedience, has been criticized for its potential to justify authoritarianism. However, it also contains the seeds of more progressive ideas, such as the equality of individuals and the consent of the governed. These ideas, though only minimally developed in Hobbes’s own work, have profoundly influenced subsequent political theorists and remain central to contemporary debates about the nature of the state and the limits of political authority. Hobbes’s contributions to modern political and legal theory, particularly his emphasis on individualism, secular authority, and the artificial nature of the state, represent a decisive break with the past and a foundational moment in the development of modern thought.
